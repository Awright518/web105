        <li>Dissolve the yeast and pinch of sugar in lukewarm water.</li>
        <li>
          Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy, indicating that

      <li>Combine Wet Ingredients</li>
      <ul>
        <li>

        <li>Add any sweetener (sugar or honey), olive oil, and water.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Knead the Dough</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Mix the wet and dry ingredients until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li>
          Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for about 10-15
          minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.

      </ul>
      <li>First Rise</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          PLace the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let
          it rise until it doubles in size (usually 1-2 hours).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Punch Down and Shape</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gently deflate the risen dough and shape it into your desired form
          (loaf, boule, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Second Rise</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cover the shaped dough and let it rise again until its puffy and has
          increased in size (usually 30 minutes to an hour)

      </ul>
      <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Baking</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If using a pan, place the dough in the greased or parchment-lined pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using a baking sheet, you can bake the bread directly on the sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake for 20-40 minutes, depending on the size and type of bread, until
          it's golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Cooling</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before
