    <h2>I loved playing tennis!</h2>
    <p id="tennis-text">
      I played tennis at Woodstock North for 4 years. I had no experience coming
      in as a freshman. Although it was tough some times it ended up worth it in
      the end. My senior year I played 3rd singles for Varsity and 1st doubles
      for JV as we had a lot of seniors. I made many friends along the way most
      I still talk to, and even go visit to cheer them on for their senior year.
      I didn't end up playing in college as i wanted to focus on my studies and
      felt it would've been too much between work, school, and tennis.
