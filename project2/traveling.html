    <h2>I love traveling!</h2>
    <p id="travel-text">
      I have been to many different places many of which have historical war
      forts. I enjoy seeing new things and experiencing new places. My Favorite
      places I've gone have been South Carolina, Florida, South Dakota, and
      Colorado. A few summers ago we went on a 2 week road trip with nothing
      planned except my cousins graduation in colorado, and to come home of
      course. We went up to Minnesota, over to South Dakota, then to Wyoming
      which was very boring, down to Colorado for the graduation, kept traveling
      to Oklahoma, then back up to Illinois.
