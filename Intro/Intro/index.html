    <h2>I like traveling</h2>
    <h3>I like going to new places</h3>
    <p>Traveling opens up a world of exhilarating possibilities, <br>
    inviting individuals to embrace new experiences and broaden <br>
    their horizons. Stepping outside the familiar confines of home, <br>
    one embarks on a journey of discovery, where each destination <br>
    promises unique cultures, breathtaking landscapes, and the <br>
    chance to connect with diverse people. Whether it's wandering <br>
    through bustling markets, marveling at architectural wonders, or <br>
    simply savoring the flavors of local cuisine, travel is a tapestry <br>
    woven with unforgettable moments. Beyond the leisure, it offers <br>
    the chance for personal growth, fostering adaptability and a deeper <br>
    understanding of the world's intricacies, making each adventure an <br>
    enriching chapter in the story of life.</p>

    <h2>I enjoy going to the beach</h2>
    <h3>My favorite beach to go to is Pensacola Beach</h3>
    <p>Pensacola Beach is a beautiful place by the Gulf of Mexico. People <br>
    who love the sun and nature really enjoy it there. The beach has soft, <br>
    white sand and blue water that's great for swimming. You can walk on the <br>
    Pensacola Beach Pier to see amazing views. Close to the beach, there's a <br>
    boardwalk with cool shops and yummy places to eat. Pensacola Beach is a <br>
    super nice place to have fun by the sea!</p>
